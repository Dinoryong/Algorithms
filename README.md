> TIPS TO ACCELERATE YOUR JOURNEY IN DSA
>
> 1. Understand the fundamentals of the language that you are programming in. Learn beyond the theory by implementing all concepts in different ways.
> 2. Understand the depth of time and space complexity. Code and test.
> 3. Focus on strengthening logic instead of studying existing codes. A better logic will help you solve more unseen questions.
> 4. Improve problem-solving skills not only specific to programming. It changes the way you think and can help you gain more exposure to larger problems.
> 5. Practice coding on sites like [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/), [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/), [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/), etc. While practising, ensure that you solve at different difficulty levels. Do not stick to a particular level and solve all from that only. This will reduce your exposure to higher difficulty questions.
> 6. Keep calm and believe in yourself. No question is unsolvable.
>

>
> 1. Binary Search
> 2. Search an element in a sorted and rotated array
> 3. Bubble Sort
> 4. Selection Sort
> 5. Insertion Sort
> 6. Merge Sort
> 7. Heap Sort (Binary Heap)
> 8. Quick Sort
> 9. Topological Sort
